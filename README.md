# IEEE PCB Workshop Spring 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to the IEEE PCB Workshop Series for Spring 2025 at the University of Utah.

## General Information

We will be hosting these workshops over 9 weeks this semester, currently scheduled for Tuesdays at 5:15 PM to 6:15 PM beginning February 4th and ending April 15th. Sessions may go overtime to 6:45 PM depending on the topic covered. To help alleviate these longer sessions, food may be provided (tentatively planned). All planned dates are shown below.

There will be two main projects presented and all participants are invited to participate in designing, manufacturing, and assembling their own PCBs, which they will be able to keep at the end. The two projects to be presented are the following:
- Variable Switching Breadboard Power Supply
- ESP32 LED Matrix

__Workshop Goals__

- Introduction to PCB design
- Introduction to ECAD software (Altium | KiCAD)
    - Altium will be the ECAD software demonstrated during the session, however KiCAD planned to be supported (limited)
- Introduction to Schematic Layout
- Introduction to PCB Layout
- Basics of PCB Manufacturing
- Introduction to Soldering
    - We will offer different levels: Basic Through Hole, Intermediate Surface Mount, and Advanced Surface Mount
- Introduction to Verification and Debugging

## ECAD Software

### ALTIUM Designer (Highly Recommended)
Altium is the software that is going to be desmonstrated during the workshop and will be the easiest to follow along. All resources provided will be natively supported in Altium Designer.

If you plan to use Altium, please complete the instructions for registering and installing Altium on a personal machine. This allows us to immediately begin our workshop sessions without troubleshooting.

### KiCAD

Please install KiCAD if you are not using Altium. While we do support this program, as KiCAD can import Altium files, we will be focusing on Altium Designer.
