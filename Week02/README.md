## Files
### Week02-Files.zip
Altium Files and Library for the Week02 Workshop. Includes all necessary files to follow along in the session.
The files include a partially complete PCB layout (unrouted - parts placed for routing) and a completed design for reference.

### Altium Workshop Week 2_ PCB.pdf
Workshop introduction presentation. Used to cover a couple missed topics from Week01, and introduce PCB layout. Note that only the intro is covered, additional content was covered in real time.

### Week02-Files-KiCAD.zip
KiCAD Files and Library for the Week02 Workshop. Essentially a mirror of the Altium files but in KiCAD

NOTE: 3D Models for the KiCAD are not loading properly, the source of the issue is currently unknown on our end (likely due to importing an Altium component library). Footprints are correct however and should be good to use.
